# TODOS

* for randomized models
    * show how null distribution evolves with increasing permutations - DONE
    * check results when trained on balanced data
    * check results when using groupwise accuracy as statistic
    * find permutations that give the best accuracy

* for NF model
    * check |V|/|U| statistic
    * try groupwise OOD

* for EDL models
    * report expected calibration error
