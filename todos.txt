BASELINE-AMRB
* find best test epochs of every model [leave-out,k-fold for strain,species]
* UMAP the latent space of each model [leave-out,k-fold for strain,species]
* show some in methodology section, and the rest in supplementary [leave-out,k-fold for strain,species]
* compute classification performance [leave-out,k-fold for strain,species]

FLOW-AMRB
* train all flow models [leave-out, k-fold for strain,species]
* report off-manifold magnitude |V| and see if (E_lo_tst |V| > E_lo_trn |V|) and (E_kf_tst |V| > E_kf_trn |V|) holds.
* train a ood classifier from |V| and report accuracy.
* train a ood classifier from logits/(1+|V|) and report accuracy.

FLOW-MNIST
* train one flow flow models [leave-out, k-fold for strain,species]
* report off-manifold magnitude |V| and see if (E_lo_tst |V| > E_lo_trn |V|) and (E_kf_tst |V| > E_kf_trn |V|) holds.

FLOW-CIFAR10
* train one flow flow models [leave-out, k-fold for strain,species]
* report off-manifold magnitude |V| and see if (E_lo_tst |V| > E_lo_trn |V|) and (E_kf_tst |V| > E_kf_trn |V|) holds.
